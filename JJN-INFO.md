# JJN-INFO: BREWPYENV

## Overview
This project, `brewpyenv`, seems like a utility script for migrating Python dependencies managed by Homebrew to `pyenv`. It identifies Brew-installed Python packages, replaces them with `pyenv`-managed equivalents, and reconfigures the environment accordingly. Includes some solid logging and cleanup functionality.

### Key File Notes:
- **`util.mjs`**:
  - Implements the core migration logic:
    - Fetch Brew formulae and identify Python dependencies.
    - Replace Brew Python versions with `pyenv`-managed ones.
    - Generate symlinks for compatibility.
    - Update `.zshrc` to prioritize `pyenv` paths.
  - Handles logging with `winston`, saving logs in `pyenv_migration.log`.
  - Code looks well-structured and async-heavy, with clean separation of logic.

- **`util.test.mjs`**:
  - Includes tests for `util.mjs`. They pass, which is reassuring. Seems to cover most functionality.

- **`index.mjs`**:
  - Entry point, probably orchestrates the workflow but isn’t shown above.

## Usage
1. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     bun install
     ```
   - Alternatively, if you’re using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

2. **Run the Migration**:
   - Execute the main migration logic:
     ```bash
     node index.mjs
     ```
   - Outputs logs to `pyenv_migration.log` for debugging.

3. **Testing**:
   - Run tests to validate functionality:
     ```bash
     node util.test.mjs
     ```

## Core Workflow
1. **Identify Brew-Managed Python**:
   - Scans installed Brew packages to find Python-related dependencies.
   - Extracts unique Python versions (`python@X.Y`).

2. **Replace with `pyenv`**:
   - Installs equivalent Python versions using `pyenv`.
   - Generates symlinks for Brew binaries pointing to `pyenv` equivalents.

3. **Reinstall Packages**:
   - Reinstalls Brew packages that depend on Python using the new environment.

4. **Update Environment**:
   - Modifies `.zshrc` to prioritize `pyenv` over Brew for Python management.

5. **Cleanup**:
   - Removes old Brew-managed Python versions.

## Quick Commands
- **Run Migration**:
  ```bash
  node index.mjs
  ```
- **Test Utilities**:
  ```bash
  node util.test.mjs
  ```

## Thoughts and To-Dos
1. **General**:
   - Clean setup for managing Python environments. This script could save time if managing multiple Python versions via Brew was ever painful.
   - Logging is solid, but the log file could grow large—might want a rotation mechanism.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Handles failures gracefully for most parts but could expand error messages for failed Brew or `pyenv` commands (e.g., missing versions).

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Add more command-line options (e.g., dry run mode, verbose logging).
   - Expand the README to include instructions on usage and purpose.
   - Consider packaging this as an NPM or Bun utility for easier reuse.

4. **Refactoring**:
   - `index.mjs` likely orchestrates the workflow; could use some comments or splitting into multiple files for clarity.
